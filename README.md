# [ECSE403--Control](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/ecse-403)

This reopository contains the laboratory projects done for the course ECSE 403, using Matlab and Simulink

## Description

Lab experiments were done using an inverted pendulum on a cart.

* **Lab0** - **Introduction** - Flashing the computer system onto the board and running the demo program

*	[**Lab1**](Lab%201/Lab%201%20Report.pdf) - Designed and implemented linear controllers in Matlab, with a mathematical model of the system.

*	[**Lab2**](Lab%202/LAB2_Report_ECSE403.pdf) - Used signal generators in Simulink to get the reponse of the system with linear controllers.

*	[**Lab3**](Lab%203/Lab%203%20Report.pdf) - Experimentally identified system parameters/scaling.

*	[**Lab4**](Lab%204/Lab%20Report%204.pdf) - Observed the response with P,PI,PD, and PID controllers for cart's position system

*	[**Lab5**](Lab%205/Lab%205%20-%20Report.pdf) - Designed and implemented LEAD and LAG compensators for cart's position system

* [**Project Week 1**](Project/Report%206%20-%20403.pdf) - Designed and implemented controller for inverted pendulum system using state feedback controller and dominant pole method.

* [**Project Week 2**](Project/Report%207%20-%20403.pdf) - Designed and implemented controller for inverted pendulum system using state feedback controller and LQR method.
